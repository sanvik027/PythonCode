"""Explanation:
Class Variable (species): Shared by all instances of the class. 
Changing Dog.species affects all objects, as itâ€™s a property of the class itself.
Instance Variables (name, age): Defined in the __init__ method. 
Unique to each instance (e.g., dog1.name and dog2.name are different).
Accessing Variables: Class variables can be accessed via the class name (Dog.species) 
or an object (dog1.species). Instance variables are accessed via the object (dog1.name).
Updating Variables: Changing Dog.species affects all instances. 
Changing dog1.name only affects dog1 and does not impact dog2.
